    Service:  UserStore
    <p>
    The UserStore service is primarily used by EDAM clients to establish
    authentication via username and password over a trusted connection (e.g.
    SSL).  A client's first call to this interface should be checkVersion() to
    ensure that the client's software is up to date.
    </p>
    All calls which require an authenticationToken may throw an
    EDAMUserException for the following reasons:
     <ul>
      <li> AUTH_EXPIRED "authenticationToken" - token has expired
      <li> BAD_DATA_FORMAT "authenticationToken" - token is malformed
      <li> DATA_REQUIRED "authenticationToken" - token is empty
      <li> INVALID_AUTH "authenticationToken" - token signature is invalid
      <li> PERMISSION_DENIED "authenticationToken" - token does not convey sufficient
        privileges
    </ul>

    """
    def checkVersion(self, clientName: str, edamVersionMajor: int, edamVersionMinor: int) -> bool:
        """
        This should be the first call made by a client to the EDAM service.  It
        tells the service what protocol version is used by the client.  The
        service will then return true if the client is capable of talking to
        the service, and false if the client's protocol version is incompatible
        with the service, so the client must upgrade.  If a client receives a
        false value, it should report the incompatibility to the user and not
        continue with any more EDAM requests (UserStore or NoteStore).

        @param clientName
          This string provides some information about the client for
          tracking/logging on the service.  It should provide information about
          the client's software and platform. The structure should be:
          application/version; platform/version; [ device/version ]
          E.g. "Evernote Windows/3.0.1; Windows/XP SP3".

        @param edamVersionMajor
          This should be the major protocol version that was compiled by the
          client.  This should be the current value of the EDAM_VERSION_MAJOR
          constant for the client.

        @param edamVersionMinor
          This should be the major protocol version that was compiled by the
          client.  This should be the current value of the EDAM_VERSION_MINOR
          constant for the client.

        This is used to check a username and password in order to create a
        long-lived authentication token that can be used for further actions.

        This function is not available to most third party applications,
        which typically authenticate using OAuth as
        described at
        <a href="http://dev.evernote.com/documentation/cloud/">dev.evernote.com</a>.
        If you believe that your application requires permission to authenticate
        using username and password instead of OAuth, please contact Evernote
        developer support by visiting
        <a href="http://dev.evernote.com">dev.evernote.com</a>.

        @param username
          The username or registered email address of the account to
          authenticate against.

        @param password
          The plaintext password to check against the account.  Since
          this is not protected by the EDAM protocol, this information must be
          provided over a protected transport (i.e. SSL).

        @param consumerKey
          The "consumer key" portion of the API key issued to the client application
          by Evernote.

        @param consumerSecret
          The "consumer secret" portion of the API key issued to the client application
          by Evernote.

        @param deviceIdentifier
          An optional string that uniquely identifies the device from which the
          authentication is being performed. This string allows the service to return the
          same authentication token when a given application requests authentication
          repeatedly from the same device. This may happen when the user logs out of an
          application and then logs back in, or when the application is uninstalled
          and later reinstalled. If no reliable device identifier can be created,
          this value should be omitted. If set, the device identifier must be between
          1 and EDAM_DEVICE_ID_LEN_MAX characters long and must match the regular expression
          EDAM_DEVICE_ID_REGEX.

        @param deviceDescription
          A description of the device from which the authentication is being performed.
          This field is displayed to the user in a list of authorized applications to
          allow them to distinguish between multiple tokens issued to the same client
          application on different devices. For example, the Evernote iOS client on
          a user's iPhone and iPad might pass the iOS device names "Bob's iPhone" and
          "Bob's iPad". The device description must be between 1 and
          EDAM_DEVICE_DESCRIPTION_LEN_MAX characters long and must match the regular
          expression EDAM_DEVICE_DESCRIPTION_REGEX.

        @param supportsTwoFactor
          Whether the calling application supports two-factor authentication. If this
          parameter is false, this method will fail with the error code INVALID_AUTH and the
          parameter "password" when called for a user who has enabled two-factor
          authentication.

        <a href="http://dev.evernote.com">dev.evernote.com</a>.

        @param username

          This field is displayed to the user in a list of authorized applications to
          allow them to distinguish between multiple tokens issued to the same client
          application on different devices. For example, the Evernote iOS client on
          a user's iPhone and iPad might pass the iOS device names "Bob's iPhone" and
          "Bob's iPad". The device description must be between 1 and
